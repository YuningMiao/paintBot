Open directory and use the following commands:
  
  qmake -project

  qmake tamupaintbot.pro

  make


At this point I'm not sure where your executable will be. For Macs, run the following command:

  ./tamupaintbot.app/Contents/MacOS/tamupaintbot


On other systems, find the tamupaintbot executable file and run the following command when in the same directory as the exe:

  ./tamupaintbot
